== Introduction

=== Purpose and content of this book

This book was prepared as a lecture material for "Special Lectures on Information Physics and Computing", which was offered in the S1/S2 term of the 2021 academic year at the Department of Mathematical Engineering and Information Physics, the University of Tokyo.

The purpose of this book is to explain the basic knowledge and concepts of cloud computing for beginners.
It provides hands-on tutorials to use real cloud environment provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).

We assume that the readers would be students majoring science or engineering at college, or software engineers who are starting to develop cloud applications.
We will introduce pracitcal steps to use the cloud for research and web application development.
We plan to keep this course as interactive and practical as possible, and for that purpose, less emphasis is placed on the theories and knowledge, and more effort is placed on writing real programs.
I hope that this book serves as a stepping stone for readers to use cloud computing in their future research and applications.

The book is divided into three parts:

.Structure of this book
|===
| | Theme | Hands-on
|1st Part (Section 1 to 4)
|Cloud Fundamentals
a|
* Launching an EC2 instance
|2nd Part (Section 5 to 9)
|Machine Learning using Cloud
a|
* Deep Learning by using AWS and Jupyter
* Creating a scalable question-answering bot
* Massively parallelized hyperparameter search
|3rd Part (Section 10 to 13)
|Introduction to Serverless Architecture
a|
* Tutorials on Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3
* "Bashoutter", a SNS for Haiku
|===

In the first part, we explain the basic concepts and knowledge of cloud computing.
Essential ideas necessary to safely and cleverly use cloud will be covered, including security and networking.
In the hands-on session, we will practice setting up **a simple virtual server on AWS using AWS API and AWS CDK**.

In the second part, we introduce the cocenpts and techniques for running **scientific computing** (especially **machine learning**) in the cloud.
In parallel, we will learn a modern virtual coumputing environment called https://www.docker.com/[Docker].
In the first hands-on session, we will run Jupyter Notebook in the AWS cloud and run a simple machine learning program.
In the second hands-on, we will create a bot that automatically generates answers to questions using natural language model powered by deep neural network.
In the third hands-on, we will show how to launch a cluster with multiple GPU instances and perform massively parallel hyperparameter search for deep learning.

In the third part, we introduce the latest cloud architecture called **serverless architecture**.
This architecture introduces radically different design concept to the cloud than the previous one (often referred to as Serverful), as it allows the processing capacity of the cloud system to be scaled up or down more flexibly depending on the load.
In the first hands-on session, we will provide exercises on Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3, which are the main components of the serverless cloud.
In addition, we will create a simple yet quite useful social network service (SNS) in the cloud using serverless technology.

These extensive hands-on sessions will provide you with the knowledge and skills to develop your own cloud system on AWS.
All of the hands-on programs are designed to be practical, and can be customized for a variety of applications.

=== Philosophy of this book

The philosophy of this book can be summed up in one word:
**"Let's fly to space in a rocket and look at the earth once!"**

What does that mean?

The "Earth" here refers to the whole picture of cloud computing.
Needless to say, cloud computing is a very broad and complex concept, and it is the sum of many information technologies, hardware, and algorithms that have been elaborately woven together.
Today, many parts of our society, from scientific research to everyday infrastructure, are supported by cloud technology.

The word "rocket" here refers to this lecture.
In this lecture, readers will fly into space on a rocket and look at the entire earth (cloud) with their own eyes.
In this journey, we do not ask deeply about the detailed machinery of the rocket (i.e. elaborate theories and algorithms).
Rather, the purpose of this book is to let you actually touch the cutting edge technologies of cloud computing and realize what kind of views (and applications) are possible from there.

For this reason, this book covers a wide range of topics from the basics to advanced applications of cloud computing.
The first part of the book starts with the basics of cloud computing, and the second part takes it to the next level by explaining how to execute machine learning algorithms in the cloud.
In the third part, we will explain serverless architecture, a completely new cloud design that has been established in the last few years.
Each of these topic is worth more than one book, but this book was written with the ambitious intention of combining them into a single volume and providing a integrative and comprehensive overview.

It may not be an easy ride, but we promise you that if you hang on to this rocket, you will get to see some very exciting sights.

=== AWS account

This book provides hands-on tutorials to run and deploy applications on AWS.
Readers must have their own AWS account to run the hands-on excercises.
A brief description of how to create an AWS account is given in the appendix at the end of the book (<<sec:create_aws_account>>), so please refer to it if necessary.

AWS offers free access to some features, and some hands-on excercises can be done for free.
Other hands-on sessions (especially those dealing with machine learning) will cost a few dollars.
The approximate cost of each hands-on is described at the begining of the excercise, so please be aware of the potential cost.

In addition, when using AWS in lectures at universities and other educational institutions,
https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/[AWS Educate]
program is available.
This program offers educators various teaching resources, including the AWS credits which students taking the course can use to run applications in the AWS cloud.
By using AWS Educate, students can experience AWS without any financial cost.
It is also possible for individuals to participate in AWS Educate without going through lectures.
AWS Educate provides a variety of learning materials, and I encourage you to take advantage of them.

=== Setting up an environment

In this book, we will provide hands-on sessions to deploy a cloud application on AWS.
The following computer environment is required to run the programs provided in this book.
The installation procedure is described in the appendix at the end of the book (<<sec:appendix_settingup>>).
Refer to the appendix as necessary and set up an environment in your local computer.

* **UNIX console**:
A UNIX console is required to execute the commands and access the server via SSH.
Mac or Linux users can use the console (also known as a terminal) that comes standard with the OS.
For Windows users, we recommend to install 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)]
and set up a virtual Linux environment
(see <<sec:install_wsl>> for more details).
* **https://www.docker.com/[Docker]**:
This book explains how to use a virtual computing environment called Docker.
For the installation procedure, see <<sec:install_docker>>.
* **https://github.com/python[Python]**:
Version 3.6 or later is required.
We will also use `venv` module to run programs.
A quick tutorial on `venv` module is provided in the appendix (<<venv_quick_guide>>).
* **https://github.com/nodejs/node[Node.js]**:
Version 12.0 or later is required.
* **https://github.com/aws/aws-cli[AWS CLI]**:
WS CLI
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html[Version 2]
is required.
Refer to <<aws_cli_install>> for installation and setup procedure.
* **https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk[AWS CDK]**:
Version 1.00 or later is required.
The tutorials are not compatible with version 2.
Refer to <<aws_cdk_install>> for installation and setup procedure.
* **AWS secret keys**:
In order to call the AWS API from the command line, an authentication key (secret key) must be set.
Refer to <<aws_cli_install>> for the setting of the authentication key.

=== Docker image for the hands-on exercise

We provide a Docker image with the required programs installed, such as Python, Node.js, and AWS CDK.
The source code of the hands-on program has also been included in the image.
If you already know how to use Docker, then you can use this image to immediately start the hands-on tutorials without having to install anything else.

Start the the container with the followign command.

[source, bash]
----
$ docker run -it tomomano/labc
----

More details on this Docker image is given in the appendix (<<sec_handson_docker>>).

=== Prerequisite knowledge

The only prerequisite knowledge required to read this book is an elementary level understanding of the computer science taught at the universities (OS, programming, etc.).
No further prerequisite knowledge is assumed.
There is no need to have any experience using cloud computing.
However, the following prior knowledge will help you to understand more smoothly.

* **Basic skills in Python**:
In this book, we will use Python to write programs.
The libraries we will be using are sufficiently abstract that most of the functions make sense just by looking at their names.
There is no need to worry if you are not very familiar with Python.
* **Basic skills in Linux command line**:
When using the cloud, the servers that are launched on the cloud are usually Linux.
If you have knowledge of the Linux command line, it will be easier to troubleshoot.
If you feel unconfident about using command line, I recommend this book:
http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php[The Linux Command Line by William Shotts].
It is available for free on the web.
